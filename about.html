      <h2>This Peenitz Is Special</h2>
      <p>Welcome friends, patrons, and potential suitors! I am Inquisitor Snoopy, and this is my story. My peenitz has a long and complex history of rocking harder than any I've ever seen, literally and figuratively. I have personally grown the highest quality peenitz, which is a guarantee I am only comfortable making after extensive research in the field, and you may rest assured that the term "compromise" is foreign to my vocabulary. The biggest question I am often asked, almost as big as my peenitz, is obvious. How are you able to achieve such excellence with consistency? Well friends, I am sorry to insist the detailed answer to that question must remain a closely guarded trade secret for now, but there is more to me than my rockin' peenitz. I am a pet lover, a home chef, an occasional hiker, and generally a chill guy. I work in computer science as a student and researcher, though I have never been good at math. I have studied but never practiced 15th century necromancy, have a white belt in Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu, and almost went to Canada once. I love to read fantasy and science fiction, and my favorite novel is Frankenstein by Mary Shelley. When you take a moment to look beyond my awesome peenitz, you'll see an intelligent and kind renaissance man looking to inspire positive change in the world any way he can. I hope that, whoever you are, you will agree to step on a journey with me to inspire that change together.</p>
